# MyCodeKitchen
---
Welcome to my code kitchen! It started as a repo for AutoHotkey-scripts, but grew out into a collection of workflow shortcuts, productivity helpers, quickfixes, personal adaptations of various scripts, autotypers, keyblockers and changers, and a variety of other personal scripts, ideas, concepts and preferences.

Mainly Written in Autohotkey, Python and C#
